    "feature_description": "Implement a comprehensive database seeding system for EduTrack application with realistic test data for Students, Teachers, Courses, and Attendance records.",
    "problem_statement": "Currently, the application lacks a robust seeding mechanism to populate the database with realistic test data for development and testing purposes.",
    "proposed_solution": "Create a sophisticated seeding system with:\n- Realistic data generation using Bogus library\n- Configurable seed data quantities\n- Relationship integrity maintenance\n- Environment-specific seeding\n- Performance optimized bulk operations",
    "alternative_solutions": "- Manual data entry\n- Simple static seed data\n- External data import tools",
    "technical_requirements": "- Entity Framework Core migrations\n- Bogus library for fake data generation\n- Configuration-based seed control\n- Transaction management for data integrity\n- Logging for seed operations",
    "affected_components": "- EduTrack.Infrastructure project\n- Database migration system\n- Application startup configuration\n- Test data generation",
    "criteria_1": "Generate realistic student data with proper relationships",
    "criteria_2": "Support configurable data quantities",
    "criteria_3": "Maintain referential integrity across all entities",
    "additional_context": "This feature is essential for Phase 2 development and will support both development testing and demo scenarios.",
