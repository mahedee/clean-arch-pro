  "body": "## 📚 Domain Task - Core Entity Development\n\n### Overview\nDefine and implement the core domain entities Course and Teacher with rich domain models following Domain-Driven Design principles.\n\n### Scope\nThis task completes the core domain entity modeling for EduTrack's academic management system.\n\n### Implementation Checklist\n\n#### Course Entity Development\n- [ ] Create Course aggregate root with business logic\n- [ ] Implement CourseCode value object (e.g., \"CS101\", \"MATH201\")\n- [ ] Implement Credits value object with validation (1-6 credits)\n- [ ] Add CourseLevel enumeration (Undergraduate, Graduate, Doctoral)\n- [ ] Create Prerequisites collection with validation logic\n- [ ] Implement course capacity management (min/max enrollment)\n- [ ] Add course schedule integration (days, times, rooms)\n- [ ] Create course status management (Active, Inactive, Archived)\n- [ ] Implement course version tracking for curriculum changes\n- [ ] Add course description and learning outcomes\n\n#### Teacher Entity Development\n- [ ] Create Teacher aggregate root with faculty-specific logic\n- [ ] Implement EmployeeId value object with format validation\n- [ ] Create Department assignment with hierarchy support\n- [ ] Add Qualification collection (degrees, certifications)\n- [ ] Implement teaching load calculation and limits\n- [ ] Create office hours and availability management\n- [ ] Add performance evaluation tracking\n- [ ] Implement tenure and employment status\n- [ ] Create research interests and specializations\n- [ ] Add contact information and emergency contacts\n\n#### Domain Relationships\n- [ ] Define Course-Teacher assignment relationships\n- [ ] Implement Course-Student enrollment relationships\n- [ ] Create Department-Teacher hierarchy\n- [ ] Add Course-Prerequisites dependency validation\n- [ ] Implement Teacher workload distribution logic\n\n#### Business Rules Implementation\n- [ ] Course prerequisite validation logic\n- [ ] Teacher workload calculation and limits\n- [ ] Course capacity enforcement\n- [ ] Schedule conflict detection\n- [ ] Academic calendar integration\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n#### Entity Design Patterns\n```csharp\n// Example Course entity structure\npublic class Course : AggregateRoot<Guid>\n{\n    public CourseCode Code { get; private set; }\n    public string Title { get; private set; }\n    public Credits Credits { get; private set; }\n    public CourseLevel Level { get; private set; }\n    public Department Department { get; private set; }\n    public IReadOnlyList<Course> Prerequisites { get; private set; }\n    \n    // Rich domain methods\n    public bool CanEnroll(Student student) { /* validation logic */ }\n    public void AssignTeacher(Teacher teacher) { /* assignment logic */ }\n    public void UpdateCapacity(int minCapacity, int maxCapacity) { /* capacity logic */ }\n}\n\n// Example Teacher entity structure\npublic class Teacher : AggregateRoot<Guid>\n{\n    public EmployeeId EmployeeId { get; private set; }\n    public FullName Name { get; private set; }\n    public Email Email { get; private set; }\n    public Department Department { get; private set; }\n    public IReadOnlyList<Qualification> Qualifications { get; private set; }\n    \n    // Rich domain methods\n    public bool CanTeachCourse(Course course) { /* qualification check */ }\n    public void AssignToCourse(Course course) { /* assignment logic */ }\n    public int CalculateTeachingLoad() { /* workload calculation */ }\n}\n```\n\n#### Value Objects to Implement\n- `CourseCode` - Course identifier with format validation\n- `Credits` - Academic credit hours with business rules\n- `EmployeeId` - Teacher identifier with institutional format\n- `Qualification` - Academic degrees and certifications\n\n#### Domain Events to Prepare For\n- `CourseCreatedEvent`\n- `TeacherAssignedToCourseEvent`\n- `CourseCapacityChangedEvent`\n- `TeacherHiredEvent`\n\n### Testing Requirements\n- [ ] Unit tests for Course entity business logic\n- [ ] Unit tests for Teacher entity business logic\n- [ ] Unit tests for all value objects\n- [ ] Unit tests for domain relationships\n- [ ] Unit tests for business rule validation\n- [ ] Performance tests for complex entity operations\n\n### File Structure\n```\nsrc/EduTrack.Domain/\n├── Entities/\n│   ├── Course.cs\n│   └── Teacher.cs\n├── ValueObjects/\n│   ├── CourseCode.cs\n│   ├── Credits.cs\n│   ├── EmployeeId.cs\n│   └── Qualification.cs\n├── Enums/\n│   ├── CourseLevel.cs\n│   ├── TeacherStatus.cs\n│   └── EmploymentType.cs\n└── Events/\n    ├── CourseCreatedEvent.cs\n    └── TeacherAssignedEvent.cs\n```\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Course entity implements all required business logic\n- [ ] Teacher entity includes faculty-specific domain rules\n- [ ] All value objects have proper validation\n- [ ] Entity relationships are properly modeled\n- [ ] Business rules are enforced at domain level\n- [ ] Unit tests achieve >95% coverage\n- [ ] Code follows Clean Architecture principles\n- [ ] Domain events are prepared for future implementation\n- [ ] Documentation includes domain model diagrams\n\n### Dependencies\n- Depends on: T002 Domain Layer Foundation (Value Objects completed)\n- Blocks: Domain Events implementation, Domain Services implementation\n\n### Estimated Effort\n**6-8 hours** (2 full development sessions)\n\n### Definition of Done\n- [ ] All Course and Teacher entity functionality implemented\n- [ ] All associated value objects created and tested\n- [ ] Unit tests passing with >95% coverage\n- [ ] Code review completed\n- [ ] Documentation updated with entity relationships\n- [ ] Integration with existing Student entity verified\n\n### Priority\n**High** - Foundation for all academic management features",
