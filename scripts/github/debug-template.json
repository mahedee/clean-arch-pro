"@{title=🐛 Student Registration Form Validation Not Working; body=## Bug Description\n\nThe student registration form accepts invalid email addresses and allows registration with duplicate student IDs. The form validation appears to be bypassed in certain scenarios.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Navigate to Student Registration page (/students/register)\n2. Enter an invalid email format (e.g., 'invalid-email')\n3. Enter a student ID that already exists in the system\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nThe form should display validation errors for invalid email format and prevent registration with duplicate student IDs. User should see clear error messages and form submission should be blocked.\n\n## Actual Behavior\n\nThe form accepts the invalid data and proceeds with registration, causing database errors and inconsistent data state.\n\n## Environment\n\n- **OS**: Windows 11\n- **Browser**: Chrome 118.0.5993.88\n- **Version**: EduTrack v1.0.0-dev\n\n## Screenshots\n\nScreenshot attached showing form accepting invalid email without validation errors.\n\n## Additional Information\n\nThis issue affects data integrity and user experience. The problem appears to be related to client-side validation not being properly enforced before server-side processing.; labels=System.Object[]; assignees=System.Object[]; milestone=; variables=System.Object[]}"
