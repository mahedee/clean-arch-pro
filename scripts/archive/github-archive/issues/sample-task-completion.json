    "work_performed": "Successfully implemented the complete Domain Layer foundation with all core entities, value objects, and domain services following Clean Architecture principles:\n\n**Core Entities Implemented:**\n- Student entity with comprehensive properties and business rules\n- Teacher entity with qualifications and department associations\n- Course entity with prerequisites and enrollment management\n- Attendance entity with tracking and validation logic\n\n**Value Objects Created:**\n- Email value object with validation\n- StudentId value object with unique constraints\n- Grade value object with calculation rules\n- Address value object for contact information\n\n**Domain Services:**\n- Student enrollment service with business rule validation\n- Grade calculation service with weighted scoring\n- Attendance tracking service with absence policies\n\n**Repository Interfaces:**\n- IStudentRepository with advanced querying capabilities\n- ITeacherRepository with department filtering\n- ICourseRepository with prerequisite checking\n- IAttendanceRepository with reporting methods",
    "deliverables": "**Files Created/Modified:**\n- `src/EduTrack.Domain/Entities/` - All core entity classes\n- `src/EduTrack.Domain/ValueObjects/` - Domain value objects\n- `src/EduTrack.Domain/Services/` - Domain services\n- `src/EduTrack.Domain/Interfaces/` - Repository contracts\n- `src/EduTrack.Domain/Common/` - Base classes and shared types\n- `tests/EduTrack.Domain.UnitTests/` - Comprehensive unit tests\n\n**Documentation:**\n- Domain model documentation with entity relationships\n- Business rules documentation\n- API documentation for domain services",

    "next_steps": "- **T003**: Implement Application Layer with CQRS handlers\n- **T004**: Create Infrastructure Layer with EF Core implementations\n- **T005**: Develop API layer with clean controllers\n- **Integration Testing**: Set up integration tests for domain services\n- **Performance Testing**: Validate entity performance with large datasets",
    "additional_notes": "This task provides a solid foundation for the entire application. All business logic is properly encapsulated in the domain layer, making the system maintainable and testable. The implementation follows DDD principles with clear separation of concerns.",
