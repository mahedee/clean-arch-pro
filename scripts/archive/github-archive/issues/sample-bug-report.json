    "bug_description": "The student registration form accepts invalid email addresses and allows registration with duplicate student IDs. The form validation appears to be bypassed in certain scenarios.",
    "step_1": "Navigate to Student Registration page (/students/register)",
    "step_2": "Enter an invalid email format (e.g., 'invalid-email')",
    "step_3": "Enter a student ID that already exists in the system",
    "expected_behavior": "The form should display validation errors for invalid email format and prevent registration with duplicate student IDs. User should see clear error messages and form submission should be blocked.",
    "actual_behavior": "The form accepts the invalid data and proceeds with registration, causing database errors and inconsistent data state.",
